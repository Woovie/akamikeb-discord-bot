# akamikeb Discord Bot

## Description

This is a basic Discord bot for [akamikeb](https://www.twitch.tv/akamikeb)'s [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/akamikeb). The main purpose is to provide a way to track what we are intending to play Monday night for community play nights.

## Requirements

Python 3.10 (As of this writing, 3.10.0b4 is what this uses)

## Usage

I've created a docker-compose.yml for simple deployment, and a Dockerfile based on the official [Python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) package.

I've also included requirements.txt for simple installation of needed modules if you choose your own deployment path.
